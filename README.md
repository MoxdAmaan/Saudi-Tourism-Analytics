# Saudi Tourism Analytics Dashboard (Python | SQL | Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Saudi Arabia’s tourism performance (2015–2024)** using an **end-to-end data pipeline**:
- **Python** for preprocessing and cleaning the raw data.
- **SQL** for transformations, KPI calculations, and structured querying.
- **Tableau** for building an **interactive dashboard** that communicates insights effectively.

The goal was to provide **data-driven insights** into tourism trends, provincial performance, and spending patterns.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data preprocessing, cleaning, formatting.
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data aggregation, KPI calculations, query optimization.
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard with map, KPIs, parameters, and filters.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Province-wise Map** – Filled map of Saudi provinces with dynamic metric selection.
- **Dynamic KPIs** – Tourists, Spending, Avg Stay, Avg Spending per Trip/Night.
- **Time Series Analysis** – Tourists & spending trends over the years.
- **Inbound vs Domestic Split** – Comparison of stay duration and spending.
- **Filters & Parameters** – Year, Province, Tourism Type, and metric selection.

---

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Tourist arrivals **doubled from 2016–2024**, despite a dip in 2020.
- **Inbound tourists spend significantly more** per trip than domestic.
- **Makkah dominates** tourism revenue, while **Jouf & Northern Borders** underperform.
- Avg stay duration and spending per night **increased steadily**, boosting total revenue.
